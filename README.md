# Happy or Sad Image Classifier

A deep learning project using TensorFlow that classifies images of people as either **Happy** or **Sad**.

## How It Works
- The model is built using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in TensorFlow/Keras.
- It takes an image as input, processes it through multiple layers, and predicts whether the person in the image is happy or sad.

## Files in This Project
- `imageclassification.ipynb`: The Jupyter notebook containing the model code, training, and inference steps.
- `models/`: Contains the pre-trained model (`.h5` file) so you can skip training if you just want to test it.
- `data/`: This is where you should place your images for training (not included due to size).
- `happy-people.jpg`: Picture of happy people to test the model.
